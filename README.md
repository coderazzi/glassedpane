GlassedPane is a simple swing component that facilitates the usage of a glass pane, usually limited to the [JRootPane](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JRootPane.html), to any swing container.

This [example](example.jar) shows it in action, with a snapshot shown below:

![](doc/example.png)

In this snapshot, one component in the frame (a table plus its scroll pane), is blocked behind a grayed, semitransparent glass that shows an animated icon. Under Netbeans' Matisse, this component appears as:

![](doc/onMatisse.png)

There are two working components in action: the GlassPane, blocking the content, and the GlassedPane, a container for both the normal content and the glass itself. It must be noted that the GlassPane is any [JComponent](http://www.j2ee.me/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html). Although it is intended to be kind of a glass blocking the normal component, it could be any other component to replace the usual one. In this sense, GlassedPane is implementing a subset of the funcionality directly provided by the [JLayeredPane](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JLayeredPane.html): indeed, the behaviour provided by GlassedPane can be implemented directly using the standard JLayeredPane; its value is to simplify its usage for the specific glass scenario.

Usage and javadoc
-----------------

The javadoc information for the library is available [here](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/index.html)

The following code, extracted from the test included in the distribution, shows how the GlassedPane is implemented in the example above:

    //initialization, empty constructor
    net.coderazzi.glasspane.GlassedPane glassPane = new net.coderazzi.glasspane.GlassedPane();
    
    //set the layout. It is a normal container
    glassPane.getContentPane().setLayout(new java.awt.BorderLayout());
    
    //add the normal component
    glassPane.getContentPane().add(jScrollPane2, java.awt.BorderLayout.CENTER);
    
    //add the glasspane itself to a swing container
    jSplitPane1.setLeftComponent(glassPane);

Afterwards, the glass pane can be visualized / hidden using code such as:

    glassPane.getGlassPane().setVisible(booleanValue);

Default behaviour
-----------------

By default, the content pane is a [JPanel](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JPanel.html), although the user can setup any other swing container instead.

Also by default, the glass pane is a [GlassPane](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/GlassPane.html). However, any other component can be instantiated by default, just by overriding the system property "net.coderazzi.glasspane.glassclass", defined as [GlassedPane.GLASS\_CLASS\_PROPERTY](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/GlassedPane.html#GLASS_CLASS_PROPERTY). Obviously, it is also possible to use the normal API to set other component, using the method [GlassedPane.setGlassPane](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/GlassedPane.html#setGlassPane(java.awt.Component))

The default glass pane merely blocks the user access to the content behind, and is displayed in a grayed semitransparent color. It is possible to define also the default color and degree of transparency, using system properties:

*   Change the default background, by defining the system property "net.coderazzi.glasspane.glasscolor", defined as [GlassPane.GLASS\_COLOR\_PROPERTY](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/GlassPane.html#GLASS_COLOR_PROPERTY)
*   Change the transparency level, by defining the system property "net.coderazzi.glasspane.glasstransparency", defined as [GlassPane.GLASS\_TRANSPARENCY\_PROPERTY](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/GlassPane.html#GLASS_TRANSPARENCY_PROPERTY)

Alternatively, it is possible to just invoke [GlassPane.setColor](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/GlassPane.html#setColor(java.awt.Color)) on the GlassPane instance.

The library is provided with a second GlassPane, [LabelGlassPane](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/LabelGlassPane.html), with adds a [JLabel](http://www.j2ee.me/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JLabel.html), centered automatically in the GlassPane. It is possible to setup a message or an icon. By default, it will use the icon found on the system property "net.coderazzi.glasspane.labelicon", defined as [LabelGlassPane.GLASS\_MESSAGE\_ICON\_PROPERTY](https://coderazzi.net/glassedpane/api/net/coderazzi/glasspane/LabelGlassPane.html#GLASS_MESSAGE_ICON_PROPERTY).

Similar functionality
---------------------

Before writing this component, I checked for existing implementations. I liked specially this one in [The Rabbit Hole](http://rabbit-hole.blogspot.com/2006/04/decoratingoverpainting-swing.html). Although it is not really equivalent on functionality (does not block the user input), it has the advantage that there is no need to create a specific component in order to hide the content behind: it is painted directly over the component to hide. The code and the list of TODOs inside discouraged me, together with the notion to have to implement the paint method -not being able to just using a JLabel, with an icon / animated icon-.
